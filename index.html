        <p class="specialParagraphs">
          I know we both shared a past <br>
          Of regrets and scars <br>
          But we can leave it behind <br>
          And just run away far <br>
          We'll let the moon and the stars <br>
          Show us where we are tonight <br>
          I know we both like to laugh <br>
          Just like everyone else <br>
          I know it seems like the world <br>
          Wants to take that away <br>
          So grab a hold of my hand <br>
          And we can leave this place tonight</p>
